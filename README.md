# What

- This is a repository that holds my universal setup for all linux/unix terminal environments

## Goals

- A simple `kool.sh` file I can download and run for any new laptops

# Plans

## kool.sh

- Downloads python, pipx, ansible
- Make it an interface to run ansible commands to manage stuff (?)
- Downloads all my ansible roles as well
- Use the following template from [BetterDev.com](https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/)
- Used on each system (including if it's a VM or not)

## Ansible setup

- Simply install roles based on the group provided
